<p>Hi ðŸ™Œ.</p>

<p>I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">University of California, San Diago</a>. My research interests are at the interface of 3D Computer Vision and AI, with a focus on Neural Scene Representations and 3D Scene Understanding. I am especially excited about combining deep learning techniques with graphics pipeline for photorealistic rendering of general dynamic scenes. I am also exploring algorithms that can learn to perceive the world around them, and use this understanding to interact with the world.</p>

<p>Previously, I spent a year as a researcher at Jio Institute, collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/a2idsia-at-xyx/sudipta-roy">Dr. Sudipto Roy</a> on self-supervised learning for ultrasound (USG) cyst localization. My inclination toward research developed during my undergraduate internships at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~pmaji/">Dr. Pradipta Maji</a>, and at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, where I worked with <a href="https://www.somaiya.edu/en/view-member/160111/">Dr. Jagannath Nirmal</a> on marine environmental monitoring using computer vision.</p>

<p>I am always eager to explore how AI can be made more interpretable, adaptable, and socially responsible.</p>
