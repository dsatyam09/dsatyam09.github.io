# Hi, I'm Satyam! ðŸ™Œ

I'm a Master's student in Data Science at [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html). My interests lie at the interface of 3D Computer Vision and Language Models, focusing on Neural Scene Representations and 3D Scene Understanding. I'm especially excited about combining deep learning with graphics pipelines for photorealistic rendering of general dynamic scenes.

Previously, I spent a year as a researcher at Jio Institute, collaborating with [Dr. Sudipta Roy](https://sites.google.com/view/a2idsia-at-xyx/sudipta-roy) on self-supervised learning for ultrasound (USG) cyst localization. My inclination toward research developed during my undergraduate internships at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, under the guidance of [Dr. Pradipta Maji](https://www.isical.ac.in/~pmaji/), and at KJSCE, where I worked with [Dr. Jagannath Nirmal](https://www.somaiya.edu/en/view-member/160111/) on marine environmental monitoring using computer vision.

Outside of research, you'll find me on the soccer field or deep into a science fiction movies (strictly no drama, real life already covers that genre). I have a soft spot for bold ideas, messy prototypes, and those problems that sneak into your head at 2 a.m. and have you sketching equations on whatever paper's nearby.

You can find my full CV [here](/cv/) and further information on my projects.
